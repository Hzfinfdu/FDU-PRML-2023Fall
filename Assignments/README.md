### How do I convert my ipynb file to pdf?

Please use nbconvert to convert your ipynb file to pdf.

#### Step 1: Install nbconvert
If you haven’t installed nbconvert yet, you can install it using pip, which is a package manager for Python. Open your terminal and run the following command:
```bash
pip install nbconvert
```

#### Step 2: Convert your Jupyter Notebook to PDF
Once you’ve installed nbconvert, you can convert your Jupyter Notebook to PDF. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where your Jupyter Notebook is located. Then, run the following command:
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to pdf notebook.ipynb
```
Replace notebook.ipynb with the name of your Jupyter Notebook file. This command will create a PDF file with the same name as your Jupyter Notebook file.
